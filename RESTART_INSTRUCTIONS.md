# Server Restart Required

The `.env.local` file has been moved to the correct location (`dashboard/`).

**Action Required:**
1.  Stop the running Next.js server (Ctrl+C).
2.  Start it again:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Refresh the dashboard at http://localhost:3000

You should now see the stats loaded correctly!
